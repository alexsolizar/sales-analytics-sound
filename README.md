# Sales Analytics Project

Welcome to the Sales Analytics Project repository! This project analyzes sales data for **ASCES Sound**, a fictitious company specializing in sound and audio components. The project leverages SQL for data querying and Power BI for data visualization, providing insights into revenue, profit year-over-year (YoY), and units sold YoY.

## Project Overview

This project aims to:

- Provide a comprehensive analysis of sales performance using structured and interactive reports.
- Highlight key metrics such as revenue trends, profit YoY growth, and unit sales performance.
- Help stakeholders make data-driven decisions for improving business operations.

## Key Features

- **Data Querying:** SQL queries were designed using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to extract and preprocess data. The query is then executed in MS Power BI's Power Query.

- **Key Metrics Included:**
  - Total Revenue and Profit
  - Profit Year-over-Year (YoY)
  - Units Sold Year-over-Year (YoY)

## Technologies Used
